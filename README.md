## Hi! I'm Zac! ðŸ‘‹

**`Software Developer`**

I'm your typical corporate software developer who is now exploring the freelancing world of coding. 
I used to work as an Oracle Utilities CC&B consultant and now working as a Software Developer for 
a Pension Administration company. I love learning new things that's why I don't stick with what
I know and strive to learn more. I like to be diverse as a programmer that can handle any programming
language being used by the client.
